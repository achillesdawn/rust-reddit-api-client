Think of the glint of sunlight on a leaf, the glimmer of a precious gem, the sparkle in someone's eye, or the glow of a city at night.\n\n\n## Making a Submission\nArtworks will be submitted as posts to the Blender subreddit that meet the following criteria:  \n\n* The post should be made before the start of August 1st UTC time. \n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240801T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Submissions+Close\u0026font=sanserif\u0026csz=1)\n* The post's title should begin with `[July 2024 Contest]` to indicate participation \n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender  \n* The post should contain a top-level comment with the following content:  \n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:  \n\t* A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where the external assets were sourced from.  \n\t* A screenshot of the project open within Blender and showing the scene's wireframe. Additionally, there should be two more supporting images. These can be clay renders, viewport renders, or wireframe renders. For the sake of keeping things interesting, these are encouraged to show different angles.  \n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, exploring, or otherwise interacting with the scene  \n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists. For example, if you used Nuke for compositing, reused an asset you've previously made, or used assets made by others, then make sure you mention these things.  \n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.  \n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community.  \n* Entries that don't meet all the requirements or that do not adhere to the theme will be excluded from consideration.\n\n## Winning\nI will be assembling a panel of ~3 judges consisting of members of this community. Judges will be instructed to consider submissions based their artistic merits, displayed technical skill, interpretation of the prompt, and other such things. If you'd like to be a judge, please message with me. I'd like the judges to be people who participate in this community, who have a firm technical and artistic skill set, and who, of course, use Blender.\n\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: July 2024` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also be able to select the theme for the next contest should they choose to do so.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post so that people can see all entries in one place, and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\n**The winner will be awarded an Amazon e-gift card worth $100 USD. You will need to provide an email and the country in which you intend to redeem the card to claim the prize.**", "author_fullname": "t2_qfpvm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "July Contest: Shine", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blender", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1dt6i6q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1719874194.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.blender", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations to \u003Ca href=\"/u/TheStarTome\"\u003E/u/TheStarTome\u003C/a\u003E for winning last month\u0026#39;s contest.

You may think about the dexterous and deft movements of an artisan, the use of sign language as an alternative means of communication, or the imprints that our ancestors left on cave walls. Think about what special meaning they may hold or what special purposes they may serve.\n\n## Making a Submission\nArtworks will be submitted as posts to the Blender subreddit that meet the following criteria:  \n\n* The post should be made before the start of July 1st UTC time. \n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240701T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Contest+Ends\u0026font=sanserif\u0026csz=1) (Edit: Pushed back by 1 day)\n* The post's title should begin with `[June 2024 Contest]` to indicate participation \n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender  \n* The post should contain a top-level comment with the following content:  \n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:  \n\t* A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where the external assets were sourced from.  \n\t* A screenshot of the project open within Blender and showing the scene's wireframe. Additionally, there should be two more supporting images. These can be clay renders, viewport renders, or wireframe renders. For the sake of keeping things interesting, these are encouraged to show different angles.  \n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, exploring, or otherwise interacting with the scene  \n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists. For example, if you used Nuke for compositing, reused an asset you've previously made, or used assets made by others, then make sure you mention these things.  \n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.  \n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community.  \n* Entries that don't meet all the requirements or that do not adhere to the theme will be excluded from consideration.\n\n## Winning\nThis month, we're going to change the winning criteria. I will be attempting to assemble a panel of ~3 judges consisting of members of this community. Judges will be instructed to consider submissions based their artistic merits, displayed technical skill, interpretation of the prompt, and other such things. The exact method by which the judging will be done is still to be decided. If you'd like to be a judge, please message with me. I'd like the judges to be people who participate in this community, who have a firm technical and artistic skill set, and who, of course, use Blender.\n\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: June 2024` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also be able to select the theme for the next contest should they choose to do so.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post so that people can see all entries in one place, and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\n**The winner will be awarded an Amazon e-gift card worth $100 USD. You will need to provide an email and the country in which you intend to redeem the card to claim the prize.**\n\n## Results\n| Rank | Artist                  | Submission                                                                                           |\n|------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | /u/TheStarTome          | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dsfasy/june_2024_contest/                                 |\n| 2    | /u/Traditional_fee_6529 | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ds1gs9/june_2024_contest/                                 |\n| 3    | /u/MisterPresidentist   | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dqug3n/june_2024_contest_fingerboard/                     |\n| 4    | /u/WiseCommunication871 | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dsa07w/june_2024_contest_i_dont_know_what_to_call_it/     |\n| 5    | /u/Nocternius           | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dseugs/june_2024_contest_cravings/                        |\n| 6    | /u/DueCloud3579,        | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1db9k8d/june_2024_contest_mr_meathands/                    |\n| 7    | /u/_lIII                | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1doh7lh/june_2024_contest_handtlers/                       |\n| 8    | /u/Kaowlzu              | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dqncii/june_2024_contest_opulence_and_greed/              |\n| 9    | /u/OzyrisDigital        | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dsf611/june_2024_contest_is_ziggy_smart_enough_for_this/  |\n| 10   | /u/Italian_Tomato       | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dse6b6/june_2024_contest_goodnight/                       |\n| 11   | /u/ExpressPair-931,     | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ds60ay/june_2024_contest_hands_and_their_emotions/        |\n| 12   | /u/AntonPekka           | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1drlq9u/june_2024_contest_hands/                           |\n| 13   | /u/Muso_john            | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dr952o/june_2024_contest_ghost_hand/                      |\n| 14   | /u/Craptose_Intolerant  | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dohwrv/june_2024_contest_rendered_in_cycles_sinful_hands/ |\n| 15   | /u/Electronic_joke_1585 | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dr6abj/june_2024_contest_grandpa_and_teenager/            |\n| 16   | /u/Fionanimations       | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1dnbg1s/june_2024_contest_blender_floaty/                  |", "author_fullname": "t2_qfpvm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "June Contest: Hands", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blender", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1d6ss56", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 43, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1719871939.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1717377878.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.blender", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations to \u003Ca href=\"/u/thedarkendkb\"\u003E/u/thedarkendkb\u003C/a\u003E for winning last month\u0026#39;s contest.

It was a fun experience where I got to meet many prominent figures within the Blender community, including a number of personalities that I'm sure would be immediately recognized here. But this post is not about me or my experience there, but instead about a call to action issued by one of the presenters.\n\nOne of the talks given at this event was by Kent Trammell of CG Cookie, entitled An Accidental Animation Studio: CG Cookie Collabs. In this talk, Trammell described a recurring community event where artists of various backgrounds and skillsets came together to work on a single artwork in a manner somewhat resembling what you might expect from a studio production. He shared with the audience his experience organizing this event, along with the challenges that came with it. This included setting a reasonable schedule, managing many artists at once, making sure there were ways for artists of all skill levels to contribute, breaking the work up into appropriately sized tasks, and other such things. But he also shared the end results that came from these events. You can see the first two collaborative artworks at the following links:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trr63G1uv7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trr63G1uv7A)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANTHeNLNUSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANTHeNLNUSQ)\n\nThere is a third that has not been published on YouTube at the current time. However, it debuted at BconLA, and I can assure you that it is the most impressive so far.\n\nNear the end of his talk, Trammell encouraged other people who manage Blender communities to consider organizing such events as means of building community, encouraging the creation of artworks, and getting artists some experience with working collaboratively. I don't know how many other people who manage Blender communities were in attendance for Trammell's talk that day, but he was obviously talking to a very small portion of the audience then, and his request felt personal.\n\nSo out of respect for Trammell and his work, and to ensure that he was not just yelling into the void, I would like to ask r/Blender if there would be interest in organizing a collaborative artwork, or effort of any kind, and if so, what things you might like see from such an event. I welcome ideas for what such an event may look like from anyone, whether you're personally interested in participating or not.\n\nShould there be sufficient interest, it would be greatly appreciated if any volunteers with industry experience or those with experience managing groups of people would offer help with organizing things. Even if you do not have the time to spend actively engaging with the project, general advice is more than sufficient.\n\nAlso, the next Ian-Hubertism that you're all bound to turn into a meme is \u003E!\"Barnacles are the gravel of animals\"!\u003C.", "author_fullname": "t2_qfpvm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Considering a Community Project: Honoring a Request by Kent Trammell", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blender", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1crbwlt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": null, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "News \u0026 Discussion", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1715898525.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1715638010.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.blender", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn April 19-20, I attended BconLA, the first official Blender conference held outside of Amsterdam.

Participants are encouraged to submit early so that your submission has time to accrue upvotes.  \n  * [Countdown to submissions opening](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240529T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Submissions+Open\u0026font=sanserif\u0026csz=1)  \n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240601T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Contest+Ends\u0026font=sanserif\u0026csz=1)  \n* The post's title should begin with `[May 2024 Contest]` to indicate participation  \n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender  \n* The post should contain a top-level comment with the following content:  \n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:  \n\t* A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where the external assets were sourced from.  \n\t* A screenshot of the project open within Blender and showing the scene's wireframe. Additionally, there should be two more supporting images. These can be clay renders, viewport renders, or wireframe renders. For the sake of keeping things interesting, these are encouraged to show different angles.  \n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, exploring, or otherwise interacting with the scene  \n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists. For example, if you used Nuke for compositing, reused an asset you've previously made, or used assets made by others, then make sure you mention these things.  \n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.  \n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community.  \n\nEntries that don't meet all the requirements or that do not adhere to the theme will be excluded from consideration.\n\nNote: Certain file/image hosts trigger the auto-mod and your top-level comment may therefore be flagged for review. Your comment will still be visible to the mod team however, so don't worry that it might be overlooked. The mod queue will be cleared before tallying the results.\n\n## Winning\nThe winner will be picked based on the number of upvotes that their post receives by the end of the month. \n\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: May 2024` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also be able to select the theme for the next contest should they choose to do so.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post so that people can see all entries in one place, and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\n## Results:\n\n| Votes | Artist               | Submission                                                                                            |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 464   | thedarkendkb         | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d39h1l/may_2024_contest/                                   |\n| 17    | Muso_john            | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d37b4v/may_2024_contest_its_a_bird_its_a_plane_its_flying/ |\n| 13    | Kamui079             | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d38gh7/may_2024_contest_robbit_from_jumping_flash_on_the/  |\n| 10    | Craptose_Intolerant  | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d386dh/may_2024_contest_rendered_in_blender_cycles/        |\n| 9     | Urban_Studios        | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d331fy/may_2024_contest_jet_through_the_clouds/            |\n| 7     | Electronic_Joke_1585 | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d3483h/may_2024_contest_astronaut/                         |\n| 4     | OzyrisDigital        | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d50nfd/may_2024_contest_ziggy_flies_his_damselbot_at/      |\n| 3     | BettaFins21          | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d4m4mv/may_2024_contest_too_close_for_missilesswitching/   |\n| 2     | ActuaryRich619       | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1d3h7q0/may_2024_contest_donut_gonut/                       |", "author_fullname": "t2_qfpvm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "May Contest: Flight", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blender", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1ci4ngw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 42, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 42, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1717218749.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1714617312.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.blender", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#39;s the start of the month, and the tradition of monthly contests will continue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations to \u003Ca href=\"/u/alpha_kilo_warrior\"\u003E/u/alpha_kilo_warrior\u003C/a\u003E for winning last month\u0026#39;s contest.

This practice will resume this month and will hopefully continue well into the future.\n\n## Theme\nThe theme for this month's contest will be unconventional architecture. The focus should be on buildings or structures that have features that set them apart from what we're used to seeing. Whether it's an unusual design for a house or a structure designed for a world with physics and inhabitants that are fundamentally different than our own, any interpretation of the theme is welcome.\n\n## Making a Submission\nArtworks will be submitted as posts to the main subreddit that meet the following criteria:  \n\n* The post should be made between the start of April 28th and the end of April 30th UTC. Participants are encouraged to submit early so that your submission has time to accrue upvotes.  \n  * [Countdown to submissions opening](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240428T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Submissions+Open\u0026font=sanserif)  \n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20240501T00\u0026p0=211\u0026msg=Contest+Ends\u0026font=sanserif)  \n* The post's title should begin with `[April 2024 Contest]` to indicate participation  \n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender  \n* The post should contain a top-level comment with the following content:  \n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:  \n\t* A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where the external assets were sourced from.  \n\t* A screenshot of the project open within Blender and showing the scene's wireframe. Additionally, there should be two more supporting images. These can be clay renders, viewport renders, or wireframe renders. For the sake of keeping things interesting, these are encouraged to show different angles.  \n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, exploring, or otherwise interacting with the scene  \n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists. For example, if you used Nuke for compositing, reused an asset you've previously made, or used assets made by others, then make sure you mention these things.  \n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.  \n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community.  \n\nEntries that don't meet all the requirements or that do not adhere to the theme will be excluded from consideration.\n\nNote: Certain file/image hosts trigger the auto-mod and your top-level comment may therefore be flagged for review. Your comment will still be visible to the mod team however, so don't worry that it might be overlooked. The mod queue will be cleared before tallying the results.\n\n## Winning\nThe winner will be picked based on the number of upvotes that their post receives by the end of the month. \n\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: April 2024` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also be able to select the theme for the next contest should they choose to do so.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post so that people can see all entries in one place, and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\n# Results:\n\n| Votes | Artist               | Submission                                          |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|  46   | alpha_kilo_warrior   | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1cf45jk/  |\n|  10   | Electronic_Joke_1585 | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1cfusay/  |\n|   9   | hardgohard           | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1cf7p1l/  |\n|   9   | elfootman            | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1cewx12/  |\n|   6   | BettaFins21          | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1ch4m9p/  |\n|   4   | Distinct_Word_6143   | https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1cfnf30/  |", "author_fullname": "t2_qfpvm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "April Contest: Unconventional Architecture", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blender", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1bsu8g6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 49, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 49, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1714537187.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1711944580.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.blender", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor many years, \u003Ca href=\"/r/Blender\"\u003Er/Blender\u003C/a\u003E used to hold monthly contests for the community to participate in, but this has not occurred since August of 2022.
